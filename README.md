The usability of this app is not as clear as I had wanted it to be. Initially there was a bottom toolbar of all image buttons, 
with only the brush size being a seek bar. However this became too complex with trying to import libraries for colors 
or trying to open a window type thing to select, so I stuck with all seek bars and basic buttons since it was working. 

When the app opens, one can start drawing right away and use the toolbar to change the opacity, brush size, and color. 
The clear button simply clears the whole screen and the other buttons open a seek bar to perform the task.
Though they all utilize a seek bar the buttons are clearly labeled so you know what you are altering - the color bar
even changes color as you slide so you can see which color you are selecting. Brush size and opacity are self explanatory
and increase or decrease as you move the scroll bar right and left, respectively. 

The inital draw function and class came from a combination of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8zAQTa2rfE and
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-paint-application-in-android/ as well as the provided links on understanding
custom view classes and the paint functionality within Android to polish the methods and fix the xml. 
The rest was a lot of trial and error with buttons and seek bars, as stated before.
